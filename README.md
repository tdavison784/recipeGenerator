#Recipe Generator
This is an application that is used to turn html recipe's into PDF files that can be 
saved, downloaded, and printed for keeping physical records of.

This is in early phase development and is going to hopefully be a part of a larger application.
This code currently works on some urls that appear to be backed by wordpress, so there is a lot
of html coding patterns that are followed for easy inspection and lookup. 
This is subject to change as the app is beta, very, very early beta and I need many more
sites to test with for better modularity.
